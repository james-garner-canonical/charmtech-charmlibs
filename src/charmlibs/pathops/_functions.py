    Ensure that ``path`` exists, contains ``source``, has the correct permissions (``mode``),

    Args:
        path: A :class:`str` or :class:`os.PathLike` local filesystem path, or a
            :class:`ContainerPath` remote filesystem path.
        source: The desired contents in ``str`` or ``bytes`` form, or an object with a ``.read()``
            method returning a ``str`` or ``bytes`` object.
        mode: The desired file permissions.
        user: The desired file owner, or ``None`` to not change the owner.
        group: The desired group, or ``None`` to not change the group.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if any changes were made, including permissions or ownership, otherwise ``False``.

    Raises:
        LookupError: if the user or group is unknown.
        NotADirectoryError: if the parent exists as a non-directory file.
        PermissionError: if the user does not have permissions for the operation.
